SimpleSiteBuilder converts a bunch of .html-s stored in directory tree into a publishable site with easy navigation...

Input:
 * one or many dirs under 'data' dir, each of them called 'Modules'
 ** within them two dirs: src and dest
 *** 'src' is a set of directories with files (html, flv, images) to be processed
 *** 'dest' is the result of processing
 *** per-module setting are stored in 'data/XXX/src/head.txt'
 * SimpleSiteBuilder itself - converter.pl and bunch of perl modules, located in '_dev' dir
 * HTML templates in '_dev/SimpleConverter/lib/SRGB/XSPT' (part of SimpleSiteBuilder, but you may modify them easily)
Output:
 * 'data/XXX/dest' will contain set of HTML pages with single navigation and style

Look also at
 * 'https://github.com/sergey-vin/SimpleSiteBuilder/wiki' for more info
 * and this - ./_dev/SimpleConverter/readme.txt for more detailed tech info.
 * and this - ./data/example_site/src/head.txt for per-module settings
