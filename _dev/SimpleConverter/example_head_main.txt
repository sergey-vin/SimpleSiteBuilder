#   * each line starting w/ '#' is a comment
#   * each line starting w/ '$' is a variable
#   ** usually it should be "$var [value]"
#   ** if 'value' is empty (like in "$var") then $var is undefined
#   ** variable's value starts w/ first non-space symbol after variable name
#   ** variable's value can consist of several lines, ending with next variable definition
#   *** if you want the value to have empty lines at the end - just press <enter> serveral times
#   *** if you want the value to be terminated at the end of line, start new line with comment or next value definition
#   *** example of single line var:
#       |$var hello, world
#       |$next_var
#       => this will cause in empty $next_var and $var="hello, world"
#       |$var       hello, world
#       |#
#       |$next_var  
#       => this will cause in the same affect as above (mind 
#   *** example of multiple lines var:
#       |$var hello, 
#       |world
#       |
#       |$next_var
#       => this will cause in empty $next_var and $var="hello,\n world\n", where "\n" is end-of-line-symbol
#   ** if variable was specified twice, second value will be taken
