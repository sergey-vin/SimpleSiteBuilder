---------------------------
1. If you want to predefine sort order for dirs and files, use _xx_ prefix for name, where "xx" is any number

1.1 The bigger value in _xx_, the later position this item will take (example: _2_ > _1_ and _0_ > _-1_)

1.2 Default number (if _xx_ not specified at all) is 0, so to place one file before all others, use negative numbers:
  * ex 1
  * ex 2
  * ex 3
  * _-1_ description
=> It will be presented as this:
  * description
  * ex 1
  * ex 2
  * ex 3

1.3 Float numbers (xx.xx) are allowed too, like in following list:
  * _2_ vocabulary
  * _1.1_ homework
  * ex 1
  * ex 2
  * _1_ practice
=> It will be presented as this:
  * ex 1
  * ex 2
  * practice
  * homework
  * vocabulary

1.4 If instead of "xx" you write "skip" in prefix part of filename, such a file or directory won't be displayed in menu at all:
  * _skip_ draft files
  * module 1
  * module 2
=> It will be presented as this:
  * module 1
  * module 2

---------------------------
2. Empty directories and directories w/images won't be displayed, so if you want them to be visible in *menu*, add at least 1 file into them

---------------------------
3. Special file "head.txt" in each folder contains configuration information for autogenerated html pages:

3.1 $index_name - show-name of index.html in menu, usually it's "Start Page"

3.2 $title - text to be placed into header image (look at the top of the screen - you'll see green image with diagonal lines and text inside)
    (@note this info is usually changed from module to module to show student where is (s)he now)

3.3 $top_left, $top_middle, $top_right - text on top of the screen, usually it's:
  |$top_left       Linguistics Department
  |$top_middle     
  |$top_right      Bauman Moscow State Technical University
