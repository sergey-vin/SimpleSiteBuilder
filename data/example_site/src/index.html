Hello to the auto-generated site, this is a startup page, you may see
<ul>
<li> navigation buttons/tree on the left side, </li>
<li> 'about' at the bottom of the screen and at the bottom of the navigation tree, </li>
<li> two types of titles (black tiny one and with images) on the top </li>
</ul>
Note! The look and feel tested on Chrome and Firefox, where paged looked quite nice. Not sure, though, that it'll work in IE...
